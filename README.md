####This project demonstrates a simple image segmentation workflow using OpenCV and NumPy.####


<UL> 1.The script reads an image, converts it to grayscale, isolates foreground regions using thresholding, extracts contours, creates a segmentation mask, and finally crops the segmented area.

<li>2.It loads an image, converts it to grayscale, and computes the mean pixel intensity for each row. The output is stored as a NumPy array (or can be stored as a Pandas DataFrame if needed).
